# Blank Typescript

## Install Dependencies

First of all we need to install dependencies, run in terminal
```
yarn install
```

## NPM Scripts

* ðŸ”¥ `start` - run development server
* ðŸ”§ `dev` - run development server
* ðŸ”§ `build` - build web app for production
* ðŸ”§ `prettier:format` - formatting typescript files
* ðŸ”§ `prettier:watch` - auto formatting


## Assets

Assets (icons, splash screens) source images located in `assets-src` folder. To generate your own icons and splash screen images, you will need to replace all assets in this directory with your own images (pay attention to image size and format), and run the following command in the project directory:

```
framework7 assets
```

Or launch UI where you will be able to change icons and splash screens:

```
framework7 assets --ui
```
